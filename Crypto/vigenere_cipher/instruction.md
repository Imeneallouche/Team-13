## Deciphering the Vigen√®re Veil

Task at hand: A message cloaked in more complex wraps awaits your unraveling skills. The keyword is part of the challenge, not given but derived from the context.

### Steps:
1. Retrieve `encrypted_message.txt` from the repository.
2. Apply your knowledge of polyalphabetic ciphers to reveal the hidden text. The keyword relates closely to the context of this competition.
3. Format your findings into a flag as `shellmates{unveiled_text}`, adapting the revealed message into the required format.

### Hint:
Focus on the shell, for it protects the creature within just as our keyword protects the message.
